    type: 'Attraction',
    description: 'Iconic safari experience on the Victoria Nile leading to the base of the falls.',
    longDescription: `Murchison Falls National Park offers one of Uganda’s most iconic safari experiences: a boat cruise on the Victoria Nile leading to the base of the falls, or further down toward the Nile Delta. These cruises offer close encounters with wildlife and incredible views of the falls.
1. Bottom of the Falls Cruise
Route & Duration: Starts at Paraa dock and heads upstream approximately 17 km to the base of Murchison Falls and back. The trip takes about 2 to 3 hours.
Wildlife & Scenery: Expect to see hippos, crocodiles, elephants, buffaloes, antelopes, and a variety of birds like kingfishers, African fish eagles, bee-eaters, and occasionally the rare shoebill.
Highlight: Reaching the bottom of the falls, where the Nile squeezes through a 7-meter-wide gorge with thunderous force, creating mist and rainbows.
Schedule: Typically departs at 9:00 AM and 2:00 PM. Cruises are often arranged through Uganda Wildlife Authority or nearby lodges.
Cost: Around $30 USD per person for foreign tourists. Ugandan residents usually pay about UGX 30,000.
2. Delta or Sundowner Cruise
Route & Duration: Heads downstream from Paraa toward the Nile Delta at Lake Albert, covering around 28 km in 4 to 5 hours.
Highlight: Excellent for birdwatching. The delta is known for its diversity of waterbirds and is one of the best places to spot the elusive shoebill.
Best Time: Late afternoon or sunset cruises are especially popular for their golden lighting and tranquil ambiance.
Private Options: Private charters are available and can include snacks or drinks. These typically cost around $270 per boat.
Why Go on a Waterfall Cruise?
- Up-close Wildlife: It’s one of the few places in Uganda where you can get this close to big aquatic animals safely.
- Birdwatching: A paradise for birders, including the chance to see a shoebill.
- Scenic Views: The cruise offers some of the best photo opportunities in the park.
- Great Add-on: Pairs well with game drives, hiking to the top of the falls, or chimpanzee trekking in Budongo Forest.
Tips for Your Trip
- Best Time to Visit: The dry seasons (December–February and June–September) are ideal for clear skies and better wildlife visibility.
- Booking: Book in advance, especially in high season, to secure your spot on morning or afternoon cruises.
- What to Bring: Binoculars, a camera with a zoom lens, sun protection, and a light jacket for early or late cruises.
- Best Seats: Sit at the sides or front of the boat for the clearest views and photo angles.`,
